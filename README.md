Hi there! This is a project from the Udemy course: [20 Web Projects With Vanilla Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/). In this project, we create a simple landing page with a hamburger menu and a modal: two very common features
found in applications everywhere.
